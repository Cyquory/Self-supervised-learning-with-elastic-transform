# Self-supervised learning with elastic transform
Similier to the solving jigswa puzzle for self-supervised learning, This repository utilize elastic transform for the same job.

However, the past experience had led to nowhere therefore the developement of this method was scrapped.

Elastic distortion can be pick up by the network alone regardless of the context of the image. The network either learned the distortion or learned nothing. I haven't seen the model learned what context supposed to be look like and got back to which distortions the image is applied to. Or i'm just not lucky.
